This is the machine learning model which is used for predicting the type of flower from  a certain parameters given to them and it changes with the change in the parameters and by the use of the microsoft azure web service this machine learning model is deployed on the web . I this model the machine learning algorithm known as support vector machine is used to predict the type of the the iris flower and azure service known as the web service is used to deploy it on the web.
